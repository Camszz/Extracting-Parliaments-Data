# How to run this package ?

Start by creating a directory "notebooks" in the repository. In this directory, you can play with notebooks as much as you want without risking pushing the notebooks to the github repository.

In a notebook, do the following :

    from src.LegiScraper.database import Database

    db = Database(config='database')

Once you'll execute the above command, the Database class will automatically start scraping data while keeping you updated using the logger.
